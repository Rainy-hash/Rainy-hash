## Hello!

I'm Rainy, a Python developer based in America. I build projects that interest me and solve challenges I encounter along the way.

**Skills:** Python, HTML, CSS, Git

**Currently Learning:** Flask

**Featured Project:** [Investment Tracker](https://github.com/Rainy-hash/profit-tracker/blob/main/track.py) A tool I built to track profit and loss on investments. Started as a Python script, now a [Flask web version](https://github.com/Rainy-hash/profit-trackerV2).
